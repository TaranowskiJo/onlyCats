Planning

For this solo project I wanted to create a cat image sharing website named after a snap chat group that my friends and I have. 
My original intention was to have users sign in and have accounts but I determined that I wanted the website to have an element of quick, anonymous sharing rather
than resembling a human-like social media platform. 
The mvp of the project was to create a place where users could send in any cat photo that they may find or capture during their day.
The overall design was altered as the single row of image scrolling felt empty and better suited to a mobile adaption of the website.
